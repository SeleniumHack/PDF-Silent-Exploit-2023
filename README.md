Selenium PDF Silent Exploit is a Windows handler that abuses the powershell protocol to make the AV evasion possible for downloading and executing payloads to host machine, followed by the next concept:

This technique involves obfuscating the source code by separating it into multiple strings and reconstructing them as new variables. Commonly flagged data types and strings are split into chunks and concatenated at the top of the script. This obfuscation aims to evade antivirus detection by disguising the code's true purpose. The dynamic reconstruction of code during runtime makes it challenging for antivirus scanners to identify the malicious intent, allowing the malware to bypass detection. However, it's important to note that such techniques are associated with malicious activities and are considered unethical and illegal.
Keep in mind that this tool assess the undetectability of a payload downloaded into memory by PowerShell and executes the payload from it.
Long story short your payload needs to be FUD.
